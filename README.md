Welcome to My pathfinding-algorithm


Here is the link http://127.0.0.1:8887/


This is a pathfinding algorithm built with maze to reach the end point(bottom right of map) from the top left(top left of the map) via the fastest method.

You can refresh the map each time to generate a new set of obstacles and the algorithm will have to find an alternative way to reach the end goal.
